## Extensions

This section allows you to map file extensions to data files and CsvPath Language files. The extensions you configure will help FlightPath and the CsvPath Framework know how to treat different files and what to show in the UI.

The config setting for data files is called <i>csv_files</i> but it includes XLSX, TSV, and other delimited files that the CsvPath Framework supports.
