## Projects

FlightPath organizes your work into CsvPath Framework projects within a main projects directory. You can create as many projects as you like and you can change the location of the projects directory.

Project directories are on the local file system. The default location for the projects directory depends on your OS and any sandboxing. In general, the location is a <i>FlightPath</i> folder in your home directory.

However, if you are using a sandboxed MacOS version of FlightPath, your projects directory will be in the Flightpath container at <i>[home]/Library/Containers/com.flightpathdata.flightpath/Data</i>. While this directory looks a lot like your home directory, it has different permissions and file system visibilities. In the case that you are working within MacOS's or another type of OS sandbox you will want to keep your projects directory inside the sandbox. If you feel you need a less restrictive environment you may want to consider downloading an unrestricted version of FlightPath.
