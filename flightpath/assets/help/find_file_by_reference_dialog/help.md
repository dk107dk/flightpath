## Find files by reference

CsvPath Framework allows you to point to files in two ways:
* by named-file name
* by reference

A named-file name is an abstract name for registering and finding files. Each
time you register a file as a named-file, for CsvPath Framework, it becomes
that named-file, regardless of the actual filename, file type, etc.

The second way to point to a file is by reference. A reference is a simple
query that identifies files by named-file name plus one or more of:
* Location and filename
* Date of arrival
* Sequence of arrival
* SHA256 fingerprint
* Any of a small number of date and sequence tokens

This dialog helps you construct and use references to find files. It helps
you create references that correctly point to files you want to use in runs.
It can be used to browse, find, and open files. And it can be a shortcut to
opening named-file and named-results metadata.
