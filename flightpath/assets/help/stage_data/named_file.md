## Named-file name

A named-file represents data that changes over time as new data arrives. Since the data's name is always the same the same process can be applied even as the file name or location changes.

For example, imagine an order processing group at a consumer goods distributor. Each month they may receive files containing orders from retailers. The files are named something different each month to indicate the time covered by the data. However, the process of identifying, validating, upgrading and publishing the data needs to be consistent over the months. To achieve that consistency, the process works with a named-file name, not an individual physical file name.
