<h2>
        Why Am I Seeing These Results?
</h2>
<p>
    The results of your run are determined by the settings and values below. The middle column applies to this run. These settings will help you better understand why you see what you see.
            </p>
            <p>
    If you are seeing mainly exceptions or logging from a one-off run try setting the error policy to include <i>print</i> and not <i>raise</i>. You can do this in the <i>config/config.ini</i> using the Config Panel. See the button at the bottom left-hand of the window.
            </p>
            <p>
    If you still do not understand your results, look to the function and qualifiers definitions in the documentation window at the top left to check your match components. CsvPath Language is functions-based and the qualifiers have a major impact on how the functions evaluate.

            Your delimiter is the character that separates data fields. For one-off runs in FlightPath you can set the delimiter using the <i>test-delimiter</i> metadata field.

        <td class='right '>
            One-off runs in FlightPath are always configured to collect lines. This is because they are run using the <i>collect()</i> method on the <i>CsvPath</i> class. If you ran a named-paths group using one of the fast-forward methods your run would not be configured to collect lines because the fast-forward methods drop matched and unmatched lines, resulting in metadata, variables, and errors only.

An error that looks like:

            </p>
            <p>
            It gives you:

        <td class='right '>
             <p>
                The errors policy determines how CsvPath Framework behaves when it sees an error. You change the settings in the FlightPath Config Panel. See the button at the lower left to open the panel.
            </p>
            <p>
            The errors policy can have a huge effect on what you see. If your run has an error and your policy is to raise exceptions on errors, your run will fail and you will only see the log trail. Likewise, if your policy is to stop the run on errors your run will terminate at the first error. For development you probably want to print errors rather than raise exceptions to them.
            </p>
            <p>
            There are two ways to set the error policy. First, the config file. But overriding that, there is a mode that allows you to set the behavior on a csvpath-by-csvpath, run-by-run basis. The mode is <i>validation-mode</i>. See the documentation window on the left-hand side for more on the modes, including <i>validation-mode</i>.

        </td>
        <td class='right '>

            If you configure to stop on validation error, your run terminates at the first error.
            </p>
            <p>
            You can set this policy in two ways. First, using the main config file at <i>config/config.ini</i>. Second, and overriding the config file, you can set <i>validation-mode</i> to include <i>stop</i> or <i>no-stop</i>. See the documentation window on the left-hand side for more on the modes.

            <p>
                CsvPath Framework can set a run to invalid if it sees an error. You can also do this in your match component rules using <i>fail()</i>. Failing a run is just a way to signal to yourself or a data consumer that the data coming from a run is considered no good.

              <p>
               This mode determines if the CsvPath Framework uses AND or OR logic in the evaluation of match components. This means that you can write expressions where if any one match component evaluates to True the line is matched. By default, all match components must evaluate to True for a line to be matched.
            </p>
            <p>
               With Logic Mode there are three ways to handle match components in lines:
               <ul>
                       <li/>- All participating match components must match
                       <li/>- Any one participating match component must match
                       <li/>- Match components not participating in the evaluation may match or not in order to trigger side-effects
               </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The top two options are mutually exclusive. AND or OR logic can be mixed, though with less conciseness, using boolean functions.

            Run Mode is used to temporarily disable a csvpath. It is mainly relevant to named-paths groups, where can be helpful to run the group without certain csvpaths participating in a particular run. In a one-off run during development in FlightPath it is less useful.

            This mode determines if unmatched lines are retained or dropped. Within a named-paths group run, if unmatched lines are retained they are captured to an unmatched.csv file.
            </p>
            <p>
            Unmatched Mode is not used in one-off runs during FlightPath development. FlightPath does not capture lines, matched or unmatched, to a file. However, using FlightPath you can do an ad hoc named-paths group run, and in that case you would see the unmatched lines file.

             Source Mode is how you can pull results data from one named-paths group member to the next in the same run. When Source Mode is set to preceding the first csvpath in the group uses the source data provided for the run. Every subsequent csvpath that has Source Mode <i>preceding</i> takes the preceding csvpath's data.csv output as its input.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that Source Mode is only relevant for named-paths group runs using the <i>collect_paths</i>, <i>fast_forward_paths</i>, or <i>next_paths</i> methods. The analogous breadth-first methods, <i>collect_by_line</i>, <i>fast_forward_by_line</i>, and <i>next_by_line</i> by their nature feed the output of one csvpath into the next csvpath in the group.
