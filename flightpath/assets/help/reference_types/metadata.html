        <p>
            The <i>metadata</i> reference type indicates values in the
            currently executing csvpath's metadata collection.
        </p>
        <p>
            A csvpath's metadata collection is
            the set of user-defined and CsvPath Framework-defined fields found in
            an external comment. External comments are comments that come before, or
            less commonly after the csvpath expression itself. That means before the
            root, starting with the '$' character, or after the last ']' character that
            closes the matching part of the statement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Within the external comment, a metadata field is a word followed by a colon.
            The modes are captured from comments to metadata. Any user-defined
            field is likewise captured.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most common function of metadata is their use in <i>print()</i> functions.
            Metadata is also seen in the results of named-paths group runs in the
            <i>meta.json</i> file.
        </p>
