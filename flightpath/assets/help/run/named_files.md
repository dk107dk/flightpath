## Select a named file

Runs act on named-files. You can see the named-files available in the top right-hand window.

A named-file can be indicated with just its name or by a more specific reference. Using the name always points to the most recent file arrived.

A reference can point to any version of any file associated with the named-file name. References can be made more dynamic or more specific by using dates selectors, file fingerprints, or indexes.

A reference has the form:

```
    $named_file_name.files.path_to_file_or_date
```
