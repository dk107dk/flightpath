        </h2>
        <p>
            <i>count_lines</i> is the number of lines considered data by the CsvPath Framework
               that have been evaluated up to the moment the print function executes. In the
               CsvPath Framework a "count" is generally 1-based, in contrast with a field like
               <i>line_number</i> which is 0-based. 0-based is keeping with how you would
               programmatically address a line. 1-based matches how people count.
