        </h2>
        <p>
            <i>lines_collected</i> is the number of lines that were collected up to the point the print function is called.
            Collected lines are returned in the <i>next()</i> and <i>collect()</i> methods (and derivatives).
            They are the lines in the data.csv file that is created when you run a named-paths group.
        </p>
        <p>
            Typically this number will be the same as <i>match_count</i>, but if you are collecting unmatched lines
            it will differ. Collecting unmatched lines is done using the <i>unmatched-mode</i> directive in an
            external comment.
