        </h2>
        <p>
            <i>count_matches</i> is the number of lines that matched your csvpath's match components.
               Match components are the logic and functions in the last bracketed part of a csvpath.
        </p>
        <p>
            The CsvPath Framework does not consider matching to be valid or invalid. Every csvpath
            makes that determination for itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep in mind that there are many helpful options. Matches can be collected or dropped.
            The matches or the lines that did not match can be collected as a set.
            Match components can be ANDed or ORed. The <i>when-do</i> symbol (<i>-></i>) can
            be used to act on a line without the line being considered to have matched or not matched.
            And the <i>fail()</i> function can be used to declare whole data files valid or invalid.
