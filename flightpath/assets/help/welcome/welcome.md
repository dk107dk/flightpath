## Welcome to FlightPath Data!

#### Better data file ingestion with robust preboarding



FlightPath Data's mission is to reduce the risk and cost of data file feed ingestion using a simple preboarding workflow centered on:
* Capturing data to immutable, versioned storage
* Providing durable identity
* Validation and upgrading using simple idempotent declarative rules
* Collecting and disseminating metadata
* Publishing to downstream from an immutable permanent archive

To get started, have a look at the examples folder in the file tree to the left. In most parts of FlightPath you will see the circled question mark icon that opens contextual help. And to learn more about the CsvPath Validation Language, just open a .csvpath file and browse the help tab on the right.

More more information about data preboarding and CsvPath Framework see https://www.csvpath.org. And to learn more about FlightPath Data and FlightPath Server checkout https://www.flightpathdata.com.
