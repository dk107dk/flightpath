## Validate a file

You can validate and/or upgrade a data file using a single CsvPath Language validation script. Validating individual files is part of development and troubleshooting. Typically, you will run groups of CsvPath Language scripts against data files in production.

Clicking this button opens the validate dialog. You will select a csvpath file and a data file. If your csvpath file contains multiple CsvPath Language scripts, you will pick one of them to run. If you instead want to run multiple csvpath statements at the same time, use the run button above this one.
