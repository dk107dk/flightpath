## Trigger a run

A run means using CsvPath Framework to apply named csvpath groups to data files. A named-paths group is a set of CsvPath Language validation and upgrading scripts. Running your named-paths against a data file results in validated files landing in your archive.

Before you can do a run you must load csvpaths into a named-paths group and stage data as a named-file. The named-paths and named-files windows are on the right-hand side of FlightPath.

Clicking this button opens the run dialog. In the run dialog you will select csvpaths and a named data file. The files you can select come from the files you have loaded in the top two file tree windows on the right-hand side of FlightPlan. The results will land in the archive, shown in the bottom right-hand window.

If you just want to validate a single file for development or triage purposes, click the validate file button below this one.
