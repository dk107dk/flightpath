## Copy files to the working directory

Each project is a workspace for creating CsvPath Framework automations. It is purely for development purposes. When your assets are ready you will load them into CsvPath Framework for automated use.

This button opens a file-picker dialog that allows you to copy files from your local or network attached hard drive into the working directory. The files you copy will be either CsvPath Language files or data files.

If you obtained your copy of FlightPath from the Apple MacOS App Store or the Microsoft App Store, keep in mind that they impose limitations on what files apps can access and where new data can be stored. If you need to bulk copy files, remember to open Finder or Exporer from within FlightPath to make sure you are playing within Apple's or Microsoft's sandbox.
