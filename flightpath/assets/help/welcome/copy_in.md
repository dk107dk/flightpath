## Copy files to the working directory

The working directory is your workspace for creating CsvPath Framework automations. It is purely for development purposes. When your assets are ready you will load them into the framework for automated use.

This button opens a file-picker dialog that allows you to copy files from your local or network attached hard drive into the working directory. The files you copy will be either CsvPath Language files or data files.
