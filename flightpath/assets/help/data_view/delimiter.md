## Delimiter and quotechar

Use these settings to pick the delimiter and quotechar that your file uses. The default delimiter is a comma. The default quotechar is the double-quotes.

When you change the delimiter and/or quotechar you are changing your view of the file. The file itself is unchanged. You cannot save the view with the selected delimiter and quotechar.

Remember that FlightPath is not an editor for CSV, Excel or other delimited file types. FlightPath's job is just to help you develop csvpaths, and related JSON files, to automate your delimited data file processing. There are many excellent editors that support CSV to choose from.
