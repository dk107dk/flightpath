## Toggle raw source

FlightPath can display CSV and other delimited data files in a grid view or as raw text. This may help you better see how to write your csvpaths.

The raw source option is not available for Xslx and other non-text file formats. For Xslx you need Excel, OpenOffice, Apple Numbers, or another editor.

Also bear in mind that while FlightPath gives you a view of your data files it does so only to facilitate developing automation csvpaths. There are many excellent CSV and text editors to pick from.
