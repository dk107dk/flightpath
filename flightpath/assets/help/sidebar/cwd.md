## Set working directory

FlightPath enables you to create csvpaths and manage CsvPath Framework from a consistent development setup in a working directory. This button lets you choose the directory. You can have as many working directories as you need to organize your different data projects. Each will have it's own configuration file, logging, and other assets.

If you pick a new directory that you haven't used before, click the `Create new project here` button at the bottom of the screen to have the FlightPath generate your config file and do other automatic setup.
