## Open config

Each CsvPath Framework project you manage in FlightPath has its own config file. By default it lives in `config/config.ini`.

The config file tells the Framework where to stage source data, load CsvPath Language validation scripts, and store results. It also configures logging, error handling, DataOps tools integrations and other important setup.

The Config panel is a set of forms that help you quickly configure FlightPath, save, and (re)load configurations for your different projects. And with FlightPath you can easily create config files for production use with less chance for errors or missed information.
