## New project here

The CsvPath Framework makes it easy to run multiple DataOps projects. Each project can leverage the same staging and results publishing spaces or each can stand alone. Indeed, projects can decide to share or not share assets and generate observability events in the same namespace or separate namespaces in any combination.

However, our recommendation would be to keep your projects simple and clearly separated. In order to do that, just create a new working directory and click the `Create new project here` button to automatically generate configuration assets. Your new CsvPath Framework project will be ready to go.
