        <i>unmatched-mode</i> configures CsvPath Framework to keep or drop unmatched lines. The values are <i>keep</i> or <i>no-keep</i>. Unmatched mode is only used with named-paths group runs.
        </p>
        <p>
        With <i>unmatched-mode:keep</i> all unmatched lines land in <i>unmatched.csv</i>. With <i>no-keep</i> the unmatched lines are discarded.
        </p>
