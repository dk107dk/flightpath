            Mode: transfer-mode
        </h2>
        <p>
        <i>transfer-mode</i> let's you copy <i>data.csv</i> or <i>unmatched.csv</i> to an arbitrary location in the transfers directory. The transfers directory is configured in <i>config/config.ini</i> under <i>[results] transfers</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
        To use <i>transfer-mode</i> use the form <i>unmatched > var-name</i>, where <i>var-name</i> is the name of a variable holding the relative path under the transfer directory. You may have as many transfers as you like. Add more transfers by separating them with commas.

        </p>
        <p>
        Note that <i>transfer-mode</i> has no effect on the original data. In keeping with CsvPath Framework's copy-on-write semantics, your data remains immutably registered in the archive. Also keep in mind that you can achieve a similar transfer result using the SFTP or CKAN integrations.
        </p>

                        This csvpath transfers its data.csv output to an external file named for a company.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        If the transfer directory is configured in <i>config.ini</i> to be at <i>/data/inbound</i>, the transferred file of first names will land at path like <i>/data/inbound/companies/01234567.txt</i>.
