        Keyword: CSVPATH
        </h2>
        <p>
            When you define multiple csvpaths in a single file they must be separated with: <i>---- CSVPATH ----</i>.
            A preceding and/or trailing <i>---- CSVPATH ----</i> is permitted but not required.
        </p>
        <p>
            Csvpaths are loaded into CsvPath Framework as a named-paths group in one of several ways:
            <ul>
                    <li> One by one
                    <li> As the set of csvpath files in a directory
                    <li> As a JSON dict mapping named-paths group names to csvpath files
                    <li> As multiple cvspaths contained in a single file
            </ul>
            In each case, the csvpaths of the named-paths group are added to a single <i>group.csvpath</i> file. Within that file the csvpaths are separated by <i>---- CSVPATH ----</i>.

        </p>
        <p>
            The cvspaths in the same file are run together as a named-paths group against one data file.
