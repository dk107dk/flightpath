        <p>
            When multiple csvpaths run together as a named-paths group it is very helpful
            to identify them individually. Their identity shows up in validation and
            error messages, the log, and in references, and the resulting file outputs.
        </p>
        <p>
        Csvpaths are given identities by adding a metadata comment above (or less
        commonly below) the csvpath statement. Comments are wrapped in <i>~</i> characters.
        Within the comment metadata fields are identitied by a colon separating the name
        from the value. To set an identity use one of these metadata field names:
        <ul>
                <li> id
                <li> Id
                <li> ID
                <li> name
                <li> Name
                <li> NAME
        </ul>
        If two are set the identity is taken in this order. E.g. an <i>id</i> will set
        the identity, overriding a <i>name</i>
        </p>
        <p>
        If you do not give your csvpaths an identity the 0-based index within the
        named-paths group will be used. You will also see the index in the metadata
        resulting from a run referred to as the csvpath's identity and as the
        automatically-set value of the <i>NAME</i> metadata field, unless you set
        <i>NAME</i> yourself. Note that <i>NAME</i> is the lowest priority identity
        keyword and is overriden by the others.
