<p>
    When multiple csvpaths run together as a named-paths group it is very helpful to identify them individually. Their identity shows up in validation and error messages, the log, and in references, and the resulting file outputs.
</p>
<p>
Csvpaths are given identities by adding a metadata comment above (or less commonly below) the csvpath statement. Comments are wrapped in <i>~</i> characters.
Within the comment metadata fields are identitied by a colon separating the name from the value. To set an identity use one of these metadata field names:
<ul>
        <li> id
        <li> Id
        <li> ID
        <li> name
        <li> Name
        <li> NAME
</ul>
If two are set the identity is taken in this order. E.g. an <i>id</i> will set the identity, overriding a <i>name</i>
</p>
<p>
If you do not give your csvpaths an identity the 0-based index within the named-paths group will be used.
You will also see the index in the metadata resulting from a run referred to as the csvpath's identity and as the automatically-set value of the <i>NAME</i> metadata field, unless you set <i>NAME</i> yourself.
Note that <i>NAME</i> is the lowest priority identity keyword and is overriden by the others.
