        Symbol: ~
        </h2>
        <p>
        The <i>~</i>, the tilde, surrounds a comment.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two types of comments:
            <ul>
                    <li> Metadata comments that come above or (less often) below a csvpath
                    <li> Matching comments that are intermixed with the match components
                            within the matching part of a csvpath
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Match component comments are simply a way to add documentation or comment out
            functionality you don't want to delete, but also don't want to be active.
        </p>
        <p>
            Metadata comments are more interesting. They can have arbitrary text, whatever
            needed. But they can also have metadata fields. A metadata field is any word
            followed by a colon. The value of the field is all the text that comes before
            the next metadata keyword.
        </p>
        <p>
            Metadata fields can be seen in the metadata of named-paths runs. More
            importantly, they are used as configuration modes. The modes control certain
            CsvPath Framework behavior on a csvpath-by-csvpath basis. Modes are powerful.
            You can read about them in their own documentation section.
        </p>
        <p>
            The id/Id/ID or name/Name/NAME metadata field is also key. It assigns an
            identity to a csvpath that can help in reviewing logs, validation errors,
            metadata, and other places where knowing what csvpath was the source is
            important.
        </p>
        <p>
            And, last but not least, integrations and other tools, including FlightPath,
            have their own metadata fields they look to for input from the user or an automation
            setup. These include:
            <ul>
                <li> test-data
                <li> test-delimiter
                <li> test-quotechar
            </ul>
        </p>
