        <p>
            The print function can send printouts to any number of printers.
            (A <i>Printer</i> is a CsvPath Framework class that collects lines of output).
            This capability is mainly used in named-paths group runs, not one-off validations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every run that has any output has a printouts.txt file. The printout.txt file contains all the printed strings separated in blocks for each printer.
            The blocks are separated by single line in the form: <i>---- PRINTOUT: name</i>. Where <i>name</i> is the name used for the printer.
        </p>
        <p>
        The <i>print()</i> and <i>error()</i> functions typically print to the <i>default</i> printer. You can pass a specific printer name to <i>print()</i> as a second argument.
        </p>
