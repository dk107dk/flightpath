## Find Data

This dialog helps you browse and query your data file staging area and runs archive.

The way you browse and query data is by creating references. References are file arrival and run schedule oriented pointers. The dialog helps you construct valid references. As well as finding files and metadata, the references you build can be used to create named-path group runs against specific data by date, path, index or fingerprint.
