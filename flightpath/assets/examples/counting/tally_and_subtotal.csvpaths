 This csvpath shows the difference between tally() and subtotal(). 

 Tally counts the number of times a value is seen in a header or combination of headers.

 Subtotal keeps a running sum of values of one header for each value of another.

 To better understand the difference and usage, check out the Variables tab.

 Also, notice two things in the print() statement:

   - We can add the tracking value to the variable to get the specific tally or subtotal 
   - After the line number reference we use two periods, rather than just one

 The two points are related. A reference (pointers starting with $) has 
 four parts separated by three bullets. When we use references in print statements 
 the reference is local so we drop the first part of the reference, leaving the $. 
 notation. Typically we don't use a tracking value name in print() either, so we don't
 have the third period. However, if we want to put a period after a reference, 
 grammatically, when there is no tracking value name we need to escape the period. We 
 do that by doubling up with two periods.
