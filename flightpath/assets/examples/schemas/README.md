# Making schemas for CSV and Excel


CsvPath Framework supports data validation using schemas and rules. Both
approaches have their own strengths.


This example shows how to create a simple schema that functions much like a SQL
DDL schema.


The DDL example is in person.sql.txt. It has a simplistic 3-table model of a
person with address and contact information.


The examples in schemas.csvpath show four variations on an analogous CsvPath
schema that can be used with a CSV or Excel file.

Run any of the csvpaths by putting your cursor in the csvpath you want to run and typing **control-r** or right-clicking and selecting **Run**.
