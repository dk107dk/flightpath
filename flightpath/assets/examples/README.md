# FlightPath examples


These examples will help you start using FlightPath and CsvPath Framework. They
are intentionally simplistic. Creating realistic examples is less important
than supporting first steps.


## To use these files:


* Check out the README.mds
* Click on the csvpath files to open them
* Put your cursor in a csvpath and right-click, selecting **Run** or use the
  keyboard shortcut **control-r**

## CsvPath Language help

As you go through these examples use the `Language Helpers` tab in the right-hand column. It offers details on the more than 150 functions, as well as keywords, modes, and other helpful topics.
