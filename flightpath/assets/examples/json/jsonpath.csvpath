   This examples demonstrates how data can be pulled from a JSON structure using JSONPath. The
   data file is in JSONL. It contains a LLM API chat stream. The file is read line by line. Each
   line has one header, "messages". The JSONPath statement is applied to that header's value.
   Keep in mind, JSONPath can be used with CSV, Excel or other delmited formats. It is not only
   for JSONL. Any format that has a header with JSON values can use JSONPath.

   id: jsonpath
   test-data: examples/json/prompts.jsonl
   validation-mode:raise, print

$[*][ 
    push("roles", jsonpath(#messages, "$[?(@.role == 'assistant')].content") )

    last() -> print("See the variables tab for results")
