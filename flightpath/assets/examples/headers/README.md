# Using headers


Headers are the names of values in a CSV or Excel file.  In a delimited file,
any given line may not have values for the headers. And headers can change or
be found at any point in a delimited file.


CsvPath Framework has many functions to help you work with headers. Most of the
functions are oriented towards creating validation rules. Some of the header
functions are quite unique. For example, in CsvPath Framework, you can reset
the headers to the values of the current line at any time.


These examples will help you start exploring the headers functions so you can
start crafting your own rules.
